In this project, I aim to develop an AI conversational application based on my personal document database and ChatGPT. The system will utilize llama-index as the underlying architecture.
To meet the requirements for production, this project will possess the following characteristics: 
1. Use MongoDB Atlas service as cloud storage, eliminating the need for local storage.
2. Include a web interface based on gradio. 
3. Enable incremental addition of files from a local directory to the vector index repository.
